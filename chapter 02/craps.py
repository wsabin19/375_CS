# craps.py
#
# This program simulates the dice game craps. The user starts with $100 and is allowed to bet on the roll of two
# six-sided dice:
#
#  - A roll of 7 or 11 on the opening throw results in a win
#  - A roll of 2, 3, or 12 on the opening throw results in a loss
#  - A roll of anything else means the user has to re-roll the dice until that same number is rolled (a win) or a 7 is
#    rolled (a loss)
#
# A win pays whatever amount was bet. A loss takes the amount bet. The user can continue to play until he/she is out of
# money.
